# We decide to not comply with PEP 8 on the following standards:
#
# - Line too long (E501): PEP 8 recommends line lengths to be no longer than 79 characters. I quote:
#     Limiting the required editor window width makes it possible to have several files open side-by-side,
#     and works well when using code review tools that present the two versions in adjacent columns.
#     Since we are all adults with big HD monitors we conform with JetBrains standard of 120 characters.
# - Do not assign a lambda expression, use a def (E731): I think most of pythons beauty comes from the conciseness
#     of the language. On the one hand, if a function is a one_liner, which is neither semantically part of the class
#     nor used outside of single function, I don't want to assign it to another function. On the other hand,
#     some predicates (a -> Bool) can be nontrivial. A variable name can fill the semantics gap.
# - Continuation line with same indent as next logical line (E125): PyCharms formatter doesn't implement that, therefore
#   it will always break as we don't have any pre-commit stuff.
# - Name may be undefined, or defined from star imports: module (F405): This is just flake8 struggling, not an error
# - 'from module import *' used; unable to detect undefined names (F403): This is just flake8 struggling, not an error
