# curvepy [(PAPER HERE)](./paper/curvepy.pdf)

This library contains various Bézier curve algorithms, as well as an educational implementation of Delaunay triangulations and Voronoi regions.

This project is mainly based on the following chapters of "Curves and Surfaces for CAGD" (ISBN: 1-55860-737-4) by Gerald Farin:

3. Linear Interpolation
4. The de Casteljau Algorithm
5. The Bernstein Form of a Bézier Curve

The Delaunay triangulations are an adapted version of the Green-Sibson (1977) algorithm, which got later generalized by both Bowyer (1980) and Watson (1980).
