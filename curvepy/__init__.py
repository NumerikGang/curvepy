Welcome to curvepy!

curvepy is an computational geometric library. It's main focus lies on

- Different BÃ©zier curve implementations and their viability
- A Green-Sibson/Bowyer/Watson based Delaunay triangulation, with translation in it's Voronoi dual graph

The technical information can be found in the single modules, the mathematical explanations and design decisions
can be found in the accompanying paper.

Please read the paper for more information.
