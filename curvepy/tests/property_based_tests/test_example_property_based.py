"""The reader is expected to read all unit test examples

Hypothesis explains the concept of property-based testing pretty well.

It works by generating arbitrary data matching your specification and checking that your guarantee still
holds in that case. If it finds an example where it doesnâ€™t, it takes that example and cuts it down to size,
simplifying it until it finds a much smaller example that still causes the problem. It then saves that example
for later, so that once it has found a problem with your code it will not forget it in the future.

For further information when testing, run pytest with `--hypothesis-show-statistics`

More examples may follow.
